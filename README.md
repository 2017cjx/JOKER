# JOKER â€” Secure Project Dumps for AI

JOKER is a web application that converts complete project repositories into **structured, text-based dumps** optimized for use with AI models.  
It provides a reliable way to supply large-language models with **comprehensive project context** while protecting sensitive information and excluding unnecessary files.

## Key Features

- **Local-first processing**: All files are zipped in the browser before upload, ensuring privacy.
- **Structured output**: Source code, configuration, scripts, and tests are exported into categorized text files.
- **Secret protection**: `.env` keys and credentials are automatically masked.
- **Noise reduction**: Excludes heavy directories such as `node_modules/`, `.next/`, and build artifacts.
- **Transparency**: Skipped directories are still listed in `project_map.md` to preserve context.
- **Contact integration**: Built-in HubSpot form with reCAPTCHA support.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend / Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
